## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

Before starting, ensure you have Node.js and a package manager (npm or yarn) installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/Swaroop-Bhattacharya01/info-fetcher-ui.git](https://github.com/Swaroop-Bhattacharya01/info-fetcher-ui.git)
cd info-fetcher-ui

2. Install Dependencies
npm install
3. Setup Environment Variables
Create a file named .env.local in the root directory and add your Supabase credentials (or other API keys if necessary):

VITE_SUPABASE_URL="<YOUR_SUPABASE_URL>"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="<YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY>"
# Add any other required environment variables here
4. Run Locally
Start the development server:
npm run dev

The application will typically be available at http://localhost:5173.

5. Build for Production
Build the static files (output goes to the dist folder):

Bash

npm run build
# or
# yarn build
🎨 Usage & Customization
API/Data Configuration: API endpoints and data fetching logic are typically found in the custom hooks or data utility files (e.g., src/lib/supabase.ts or src/api/).

Theme Customization: To change colors, fonts, or break points, update the tailwind.config.js file.

Component Structure: All UI components live in src/components/. Feel free to add new ones or modify existing ones based on the Shadcn UI framework.

New Views: Add new data views by creating a folder in src/pages/ or similar, wiring in the route, and component logic using React Router DOM.

✅ Why This Project Rocks
User-centred design: Focused on readability, minimalism, and clarity.

Flexible architecture: Easily adapt or plug-in new data sources or UI views.

Quick to deploy: Minimal configuration needed to get live on platforms like Render.

Maintainable code-base: Modular structure helps you iterate fast and keep code clean.

Ready for growth: Whether you're building a small dashboard or scaling up to a full-blown frontend, it has you covered.
